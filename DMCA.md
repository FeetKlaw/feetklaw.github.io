Upon receipt of a **properly formatted DMCA takedown notice**, Feet Klaw
will, in good faith and without undue delay:

- Review the notice for legal sufficiency
- Disable access to or remove the identified material where required
- Take reasonable steps consistent with Safe Harbor obligations

Compliance with a takedown request:
- Is performed **without admission of liability**

original complaining party as required by law.
